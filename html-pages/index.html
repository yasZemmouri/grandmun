                <h3>Ambassador Carmelo Inguanez</h3>
                <p>After graduating from the universities of Malta, Oxford, and Bruxelles, His Excellency Mr. Inguanez
                    started what was to become a busy and successful career as a diplomat for Malta. In the United
                    Nations Organization, H. E. Mr. Inguanez worked for the UN Organization for Food and Agriculture
                    from 2011 and was named permanent representative of the Maltese Republic at the UN in 2016. H. E.
                    was appointed ambassador to Russia (2009-2011), to Italy (2011-2013), to Tunisia (2013-2016) and to
                    France (since december of 2019). Mr. Inguanez also played a role in the integration of Malta into
                    the European Union, by holding the position of Coordinator of foreign relations with the EU during
                    negotiations Maltaâs entry in the union.</p>
                <p>We have had the immense honor to be able to interview His Excellency Mr. Carmelo Inguanez at the
                    Maltese Embassy in Paris within the framework of GRANDMUN 2023. This inspiring interview will be
                    broadcasted during the conference on April 14th.</p>
                <p>We would like to thank H.E. Mr. Inguanez for welcoming Amaury Michaux (videographer and
                    photographer), James Rebiscoul (delegate of the USA in SPC2) and Marine (Co-Secretary General) at
                    the Malta Embassy for this insightful talk. The GRANDMUN board will forever be grateful for this
                    amazing opportunity.</p>
                <h3>His Excellency Mister DiÃ©go Colas</h3>
                <p>H. E. Mr. DiÃ©go Colas has dedicated his whole career to representing France abroad and taking care of
                    foreign affairs within the French government. After working in European Affairs for the Foreign
                    Ministerâs Cabinet, H. E. Mr. Colas was appointed advisor at the French Embassy in London
                    (2004-2008) and at the French Embassy in Algeria (2008-2012). Then, from 2016 to 2019, Mr. Colas
                    held the position of judicial affairs at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, before being named
                    Ambassador to Georgia, in August of 2019.</p>
                <p>Mr. Colas studied at Georgetown University, Science Po Paris and at the Ecole Nationale de
                    lâAdministration (ENA). He was also a French Air Force Reserves officer, earlier on in his career.
                </p>
                <p>There is no way the GRANDMUN board could thank His Excellency Mr. Colas for accepting our invitation
                    to come and speak at our event about the sovereignty of former Soviet states. His many years of
                    experience in international relations and his interest for Eastern European countries will surely
                    make for an enlightening speech.</p>

                                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve the health and
                                            well-being of individuals, communities, and states. However, certain uses of
                                            AI could also undermine international peace and security by, raising
                                            concerns about safety and security of the technology, accelerating the pace
                                            of armed conflicts, or loosening human control over the means of war. How
                                            can we, as delegates, mitigate the potential catastrophic effects of these
                                            state-of-the-art weapons?</p>

                                        <p>The Soviet Union was dissolved more than 30 years ago. In its wake, the Union
                                            of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), produced 15 sovereign states. These
                                            states included: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
                                            Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
                                            Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Each of these countries is now self-governed and is
                                            internationally recognized as a sovereign nation. However, recently events
                                            have transpired that potentially threaten peace in the region, and the right
                                            to autonomy of former Soviet republics. Is a peaceful solution between
                                            conflicting former Soviet States conceivable?</p>

                                        <p>With the rapid technological advancement of recent years, computers are
                                            increasingly encroaching on domains that were previously considered
                                            exclusively human. The astonishing progress in such areas as artificial
                                            intelligence (AI), robotics, 3D printing and genetics has enabled computers
                                            to perform the tasks of architects, medical doctors, music composers and
                                            even a 16th century Dutch master of painting. This is furthermore made
                                            unsettling by recently unveiled world population trends. Latest UN DESA data
                                            show that, by 2050, our population is expected to reach 9.8 billion people,
                                            over 6 billion of whom will be of working age. Meanwhile, we are already
                                            struggling with finding decent employment for 71 million young people
                                            worldwide.</p>
                                        <p> It is easy to see why new technologies are increasingly viewed as a major
                                            threat to labour markets. Some estimates even claim that a staggering 80 per
                                            cent of jobs run the risk of being automated in the coming decades.</p>
                                        <p> Nearly every day brings news of remarkable feats achieved by computers or
                                            robots, and with them a gnawing question: Will machines edge us out of brain
                                            jobs?</p>

                                        <p>The issue of statelessness is usually portrayed as an "invisible problem" in
                                            today's world, since most of the people take membership of a State for
                                            granted. More than 10 million individuals in all regions of the world are
                                            stateless, which means that they are not considered as nationals by any
                                            state under the operation of its law. Most of the time, and so as to
                                            temporarily cease the chaotic procedures and vanish proof of those groups,
                                            stateless persons are being registered as persons of "unknown nationality"
                                            or "non-citizens". This phenomenon comprises violation of one fundamental
                                            right protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which
                                            affirms that "everyone has the right to a nationality". As a result,
                                            stateless people are dealing with issues such as lack of education,
                                            healthcare and employment, amenities that all nationalities provide on a
                                            daily basis. Will these people ever manage to find a place in this world?
