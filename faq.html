    <main> What do I wear? In MUN, we like to look sharp, which is why here at GRANDMUN, we impose a dress code that you
        should go by when on D-Day. For men : a business-type suit, preferably with a tie. For women : anything from a
        formal suit to a formal dress or skirt topped with a blazer. Please make sure you come looking presentable,
        while wearing something you’re comfortable with. Should I bring my own lunch? No, we don’t insist on delegates
        bringing their own lunch on the day of the conference. There are Boulangeries-Patisseries in Rue Royale, five
        minutes away from Notre-Dame du Grandchamp. You’ll have time to purchase something in one of them at lunch-time.
        For the Troisièmes joining us, you’ll be able to do the exact same thing, while being accompanied by your
        teacher. Why do I need to pay to attend GRANDMUN ? We understand why you ask yourselves this question. The
        GRANDMUN board has decided to impose a financial participation of 12€ per delegate in order to help raise funds
        for the Senegal project. The Senegal project is a charity put in place by NDG, aiming to fly a few students to
        Senegal in the summer of 2023 to build a library in the city of Pikine. For more information about the project
        and the reason we humbly impose a fee to your attendance, please refer to the explanatory video on the present
        website. How to conduct efficient and useful research? Research can be a daunting task: there’s so much
        information out there, in articles, websites, books. What we recommend is carefully reading over the research
        reports the GRANDMUN board has uploaded for you on the present website; they are made to give you a head start
        into collecting information in order to shape interesting and constructive arguments. Next, we encourage you to
        go into deeper research about the different notions that appear in the research reports. To do that, you can
        visit reputable websites that specialize in history and geopolitics, but also crowd contributed websites, which
        are also a great source of information if you cross verify the info you find on there. You are also going to
        find very useful points on government websites, it be on your assigned country’s government website, on your
        rival’s, or on your ally’s. Visiting government owned websites will show you first hand how the administration
        you are representing approaches the problems you will debating about, which will help you speak on behalf of
        your country and not from your own stance. Articles in paper newspapers are a valuable source of information as
        well. Make sure to take a look into your parents’ newspaper, it be daily French News (which also focuses on
        pressing world issues) or papers who focus on a more globalized view of geopolitics. The subjects we chose for
        this conference are present day issues that tend to change everyday; chances are you’re always going to find
        something interesting to read about. Last but not least, don’t hesitate to watch documentaries and videos from
        certified historians and politicians: sometimes hearing an expert talk makes our understanding of a complicated
        issue a quicker process. Have a blast researching! How do get to speaking in GRANDMUN if I’m new to MUN ? Answer
        : We know that, among other things, public speaking is one of the hardest skills to acquire; but you have to
        start somewhere ! Taking the mic during your first MUN conference is definitely an accomplishment in itself. But
        how do you go about doing it? The first tip we have for first timers is to start small. By that we mean talking
        for very short periods of time; for instance : asking a Point of Information (aka a question) when the Chair and
        the delegate who has the floor allow it. You can take your time preparing it while the delegate who has the
        floor is delivering their speech. After your first ever POI, you’ll notice questions and speeches will seem much
        easier than they did before. Gradually, you should take opportunities to speak in front of your committee: the
        more you do it, the more it’ll feel like a natural thing to do. Remember: we are all here to have a good time
        and a productive debate. Don’t let experienced delegates intimidate you, because everyone’s opinion matters!
