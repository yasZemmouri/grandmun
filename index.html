                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve the health and well-being of individuals,
                    communities, and states. However, certain uses of AI could also undermine international peace and
                    security by, raising concerns about safety and security of the technology, accelerating the pace of
                    armed conflicts, or loosening human control over the means of war. How can we, as delegates,
                    mitigate the potential catastrophic effects of these state-of-the-art weapons?</p>

                <h2>Special Conference 2</h2>
                <p>The Soviet Union was dissolved more than 30 years ago. In its wake, the Union of Soviet Socialist
                    Republics (USSR), produced 15 sovereign states. These states included: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
                    Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan,
                    Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Each of these countries is now self-governed and is
                    internationally recognized as a sovereign nation. However, recently events have transpired that
                    potentially threaten peace in the region, and the right to autonomy of former Soviet republics. Is a
                    peaceful solution between conflicting former Soviet States conceivable?</p>

                <h2>Economic and Social Council</h2>
                <p>With the rapid technological advancement of recent years, computers are increasingly encroaching on
                    domains that were previously considered exclusively human. The astonishing progress in such areas as
                    artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, 3D printing and genetics has enabled computers to perform
                    the tasks of architects, medical doctors, music composers and even a 16th century Dutch master of
                    painting. This is furthermore made unsettling by recently unveiled world population trends. Latest
                    UN DESA data show that, by 2050, our population is expected to reach 9.8 billion people, over 6
                    billion of whom will be of working age. Meanwhile, we are already struggling with finding decent
                    employment for 71 million young people worldwide. It is easy to see why new technologies are
                    increasingly viewed as a major threat to labour markets. Some estimates even claim that a staggering
                    80 per cent of jobs run the risk of being automated in the coming decades. Nearly every day brings
                    news of remarkable feats achieved by computers or robots, and with them a gnawing question: Will
                    machines edge us out of brain jobs?</p>
